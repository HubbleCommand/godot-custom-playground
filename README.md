# godot-custom-playground

Godot project I use to test my custom builds and additions to the Godot engine.

My fork of the Godot engine is [here](https://github.com/HubbleCommand/godot)

## Image Tests
Tests for cropping, shearing, rotating

## Canvas Tests (defunct)
Tests for custom drawing conic shapes

Defunt as at it's core, all shapes are just polygons/polylines,
so no real point in doing conics in the engine
